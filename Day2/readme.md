# ðŸ“˜ Day 2 - JavaScript Objects & Object Methods

Welcome to Day 2 of our JavaScript learning journey!  
Today, we dive deep into **Objects** and **Object Methods**, which are super important in real-world JS applications.

## ðŸ§  What are Objects?

An object is a collection of **key-value pairs**. Each key is a property, and each property has a value.

```js
let person = {
  name: "Krishna",
  age: 19,
  city: "Delhi"
};
