# 🧠 What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a powerful, high-level programming language that brings **life and interactivity** to websites. It runs directly in your browser and lets you:

- Show alerts when users click a button
- Validate forms before submission
- Add dynamic features like sliders, popups, and animations
- Build interactive web apps, games, and even mobile or server-side apps (using Node.js)

> 🧩 Think of it like this:  
> **HTML** is the structure, **CSS** is the design, and **JavaScript** is the brain that makes it all work together.
